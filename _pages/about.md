Welcome to my personal website powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This site showcases my research, publications, and academic activities.

## About Me

I am **Haoyang Wu**, currently a Ph.D. candidate (Class of 2025) at the **School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation**, **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**.

My research focuses primarily on:

- **Multi-source remote sensing information processing**
- **Object detection and tracking in complex scenarios**

I have published my research findings in journals such as *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing* and actively contribute to advancing methodologies in remote sensing and artificial intelligence applications.

## GitHub and Site Information

This website is created using the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, a Jekyll-based system forked from the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme by Michael Rose. It provides features tailored specifically for academics, including:

- Publications list
- Talks and presentations
- Teaching information
- Personal blog posts
- Portfolio showcases
- Dynamically-generated CV

All contents, including publications, talks, and other academic activities, are stored in structured markdown and YAML files. Whenever updates are made and pushed to GitHub, the website automatically rebuilds itself and remains publicly available.

You can also fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), customize it, and create your own academic website for free, hosted directly on GitHub pages.
