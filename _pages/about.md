Welcome to my personal academic website. This site showcases my research, publications, and academic activities. Please feel free to contact me via email: **whycoding@163.com**.

## About Me

I am **Haoyang Wu**, currently a Ph.D. student in Control Science and Engineering at the **School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation**, **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**. My advisor is Prof. [Shoudong Han](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/hanshoudong).

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Technology from Southwest Petroleum University in 2022 and my Master of Engineering degree in Traffic Information Engineering and Control from Shanghai Maritime University in 2025. During my master's studies, I was awarded the National Scholarship and recognized as an Outstanding Graduate of Shanghai. Additionally, I hold one national invention patent and eight computer software copyrights.

My research interests primarily focus on:

- **Multi-source remote sensing information processing**
- **Object detection and tracking in complex scenarios**

## Publications

During my master's study, I published and submitted research articles in prestigious international remote sensing journals as the first author:

1. **AIS Data-Guided Geolocation Correction Method for Low-Orbit Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery**
   - *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)*, JCR Q1, IF=5.5. **(Published)**

2. **Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Model for Typhoon-Induced Vessel Delay Prediction Based on Satellite Remote Sensing and AIS Data**
   - *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (IEEE TGRS)*, JCR Q1, IF=8.8. **(Under Review)**

These publications address remote sensing imagery and AIS data fusion problems, specifically focusing on static geometric correction and dynamic spatiotemporal prediction in intelligent maritime transportation scenarios.

## Industrial-Academic Cooperation Projects

During my master's period, I participated in industrial-academic cooperation projects directly serving maritime administrations:

- **Visual Algorithm Engineer** at Shanghai hiFleet Technology Co., Ltd. (June 2023 - April 2025)

1. **Jiujiang Inland River Intelligent Gate System** (Deployed and in use by Jiujiang Maritime Bureau)
   - Constructed a real-time ship identification and tracking platform based on fixed-position cameras, serving inland river gate monitoring (June 2023 - Dec 2024)
   - Technologies: YOLOv8, Deep SORT, AIS data fusion and matching.

2. **Unmanned Intelligent Monitoring and Supplementary Blind-area System** (Deployed in Jiujiang and Jinshan Maritime Bureaus)
   - Solved visual blind-spot recognition and dynamic airspace monitoring under extreme weather (June 2024 - Feb 2025)
   - Technologies: Hybrid CNN-Transformer, multi-object detection and route planning, AIS trajectory scheduling.

3. **hiFleet Multimodal Vision Fusion Identification Platform** (Under development on hiFleet platform)
   - Integrated visual, AIS, and remote sensing data for unified sensing systems, achieving model-level integration (Sept 2024 - April 2025)
   - Technologies: Spatiotemporal Attention, ESRGAN image enhancement, Transformer fusion models.
