### Course: Maritime Big Data Technologies （航运大数据技术）  
**Institution**: Shanghai Maritime University （上海海事大学）  
**Level**: Graduate (Master's level)

As part of my teaching experience at Shanghai Maritime University, I lectured on the postgraduate course **"Maritime Big Data Technologies"**, which focuses on the theoretical foundation and applied methods of data-driven technologies in the modern shipping industry. The course emphasizes the integration of **computer vision techniques and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data**, aiming to provide students with a solid understanding of how multi-source data fusion can enhance maritime situational awareness and decision-making.

Key teaching contents included:

- **Introduction to Maritime Big Data**: Characteristics, sources, challenges, and opportunities in the context of intelligent shipping.
- **AIS System Fundamentals**: Structure, information types (static, dynamic, voyage), and limitations.
- **Remote Sensing in Maritime Applications**: Use of optical satellite imagery for vessel monitoring.
- **Computer Vision in Shipping**: Object detection and tracking methods (e.g., YOLO, Deep SORT), with applications in port and river scenarios.
- **Fusion of AIS and Visual Data**: Strategies for temporal and spatial alignment, feature-level and decision-level fusion, error modeling, and real-world case studies.
- **Applications in Inland River Traffic and Coastal Surveillance**: Use of data fusion for ship localization, trajectory prediction, and abnormal behavior detection.

In this course, I guided students through practical case analyses using real-world datasets from inland river and coastal shipping scenarios. The course incorporated discussions on cutting-edge research such as AIS-guided deep learning models, including **GeoAISNet**, and their applications in remote sensing image correction and maritime monitoring.

This teaching experience not only deepened students' technical competencies in maritime AI applications but also fostered interdisciplinary thinking across transportation engineering, remote sensing, and machine learning.
