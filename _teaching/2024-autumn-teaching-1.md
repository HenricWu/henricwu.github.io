### Course: Maritime Big Data Technologies 
**Institution**: Shanghai Maritime University
**Level**: Graduate (Master's level)

In the spring semester of 2023, I served as the **course lecturer** for the postgraduate course **"Maritime Big Data Technologies"** at **Shanghai Maritime University**. The course focused on the theoretical foundation and applied methods of data-driven technologies in the modern shipping industry. It emphasized the integration of **computer vision techniques and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data**, aiming to provide students with a solid understanding of how multi-source data fusion can enhance maritime situational awareness and decision-making.

### Key Responsibilities

- Delivering lectures on **maritime data characteristics, AIS structure**, and **remote sensing imagery**.
- Introducing students to **object detection algorithms** such as YOLO and Deep SORT in maritime environments.
- Demonstrating methods for **temporal-spatial alignment and fusion** of AIS and vision data.
- Guiding **hands-on case analysis projects** using real-world datasets from inland river and coastal surveillance.
- Discussing advanced applications such as **GeoAISNet** for remote sensing correction and vessel behavior modeling.

### Learning Outcomes

Through this course, students developed the ability to apply machine learning and vision techniques in shipping scenarios, particularly in the context of **remote sensingâ€“AIS fusion**, enabling improved vessel tracking, anomaly detection, and maritime safety analytics. The course also fostered interdisciplinary thinking across **transportation engineering, geospatial computing**, and **AI-driven perception systems**.
