In the fall semester of 2021, I served as a **Teaching Assistant** for the undergraduate course **Object-Oriented Programming (C++)** at **Southwest Petroleum University**, School of Computer Science and Technology. The course introduced students to fundamental and advanced concepts in C++ programming, with a strong emphasis on abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

As a TA, I assisted the instructor in both theoretical and hands-on teaching tasks, including:

### Key Responsibilities

- Guiding students during **lab sessions**, helping them implement object-oriented designs and debug C++ code.
- **Explaining core concepts** such as class design, constructors/destructors, operator overloading, and memory management.
- Providing **one-on-one assistance** to students struggling with syntax, logic, or compilation issues during programming exercises.
- **Designing and evaluating assignments**, ensuring alignment with course objectives and fostering practical problem-solving skills.
- Assisting with the use of integrated development environments (IDEs) such as **Visual Studio** or **Code::Blocks**.

### Learning Outcomes

Through this teaching experience, I helped students transition from basic procedural programming to object-oriented design thinking, equipping them with the foundational skills required for future coursework in software engineering and systems development. The experience also strengthened my own pedagogical understanding and communication abilities in a technical teaching environment.
